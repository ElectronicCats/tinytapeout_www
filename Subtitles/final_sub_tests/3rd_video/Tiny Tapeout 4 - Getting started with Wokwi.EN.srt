00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,253
In this video you're
going to learn how to use

2
00:00:02,278 --> 00:00:05,760
Wokwi to draw and simulate
simple digital designs.

3
00:00:07,766 --> 00:00:11,280
After you open the template you
can minimize this area over here.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,080
Left click and drag to move around.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,960
Scroll wheel to zoom in and
out. I also like to turn the grid on.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,680
We have two modes in Wokwi, drawing and
simulation. We'll start off by looking at drawing.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,560
To add more logic gates you can use the plus button, then
start typing logic and you'll see all the available gates.

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,200
You can select a component and drag it.
The wires will stay connected.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,360
You can adjust the wires by clicking
them and using the handles.

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:49,040
You can also change the colors. For neat
wiring you can click waypoints as you draw.

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:56,080
To copy a component select it and press D. To
copy a group of components including their wires

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:04,400
select them with shift, left click and drag. Then press D. Use
the delete key to delete components or groups of components.

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,240
Control Z and control
Y for undo and redo.

14
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:16,800
For more Wokwi tips check the FAQ here.

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:25,520
It's possible to create a bad circuit. For
example by connecting two outputs together

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:32,000
or making a short circuit. If that happens you'll get
an ERC box up here and you'll have to solve it before

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,280
your design can be made. Now we'll simulate
the design by clicking the green play button.

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,040
You can click individual switches but if you select
the whole switch you can also use your computer

19
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,440
keyboard to toggle the switches. You can see
how the output changes as I change the input.

20
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,640
For clock designs you can use our automatic clock
generator. With the switch this way the clock

21
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,000
will be running freely. Like this we can click
the button to create a single clock step.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,560
For more information about the clock check the
FAQ. A little debug tip I like is to add an LED

23
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,160
to important parts of the circuit. That can help
you understand what's going on inside a circuit.

24
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,560
A nice feature for testing is creating a truth
table. If you create a new file on the left

25
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,560
called truthtable.md you can create a truth
table that will then be used to test your design.

26
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,080
For documentation on how it works read the
documentation here. Only logic gates that are connected

27
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,920
between the input and output boards are used. You
can leave any extra debugging LEDs or extra circuit

28
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,720
elements outside of the input and output
boards. They'll be ignored by the ASIC tools.

29
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,520
Make sure you save a copy of your design.

30
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,680
You'll get a new number in the URL here and that's
the number you need to submit to get your design

31
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:10,480
manufactured. To learn more about digital
design you can follow our lessons here.
