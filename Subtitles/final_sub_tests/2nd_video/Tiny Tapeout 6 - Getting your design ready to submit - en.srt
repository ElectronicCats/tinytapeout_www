00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In this video we're going to learn how
to use the Tiny Tapeout GitHub template
to turn your design into the ASIC files
we need to manufacture the chip.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
If you don't already have a GitHub
account you'll need to create one.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Then navigate to one of the template
repositories. We have one for Wokwi
designs and another one for Verilog or
other HDLs.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'll use the Wokwi template for now.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Click the "Use this template" button.
This creates your own copy of the
repository.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
For open source projects GitHub pays for
the cloud compute which we use to make
the ASIC files.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's turned on by default but we still
need to allow the actions to create the
results page.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We have the instructions here but I'll
show you how to do it now.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Go to your repository settings page,
"Pages", then set build and deploy source
to "GitHub actions".

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Now we're ready to adapt the template to
our own projects by editing the info.yaml
file.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
For Wokwi projects you need to change
the project's Wokwi ID to match the
number in your Wokwi project.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
For HDL projects like Verilog or Amaranth
we use the source file section here.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That's covered in a separate video
called "Working with an HDL".

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Okay so let's set the Wokwi ID to
match our project.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll copy the last part of the projects
URL and replace the 0 with it.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Most simple designs will fit into one
tile.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If you need more space you can change
the tile setting to get more space.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Bigger designs cost more.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
If you're not sure just start with one
and see what happens.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We also need to fill out the title,
author and so on.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
If you use Discord then put your Discord
name here and when you submit a design

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
we'll add you to the Tapeout role.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Further down in the file there's a
section to describe what the pins do.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And this is really useful for testing
other people's designs so please fill it
in.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Then hit the commit button to save your
changes.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There's one more file you have to edit,
the info.md inside the docs directory.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This is important for a few reasons.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
First is that because everyone who
orders a chip will also get your design.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's nice if they can understand how to
experiment with it.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The second reason is that by the time
the chips come back you'll probably have
forgotten how it works

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
and you'll be glad you wrote down some
instructions.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You can make the documentation better by
adding pictures and links to extra
documentation.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
After filling in all the details press
the commit button.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This starts the GitHub actions running.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You can access the results using the
actions tab at the top here.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
We have three actions.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
One for documentation that shows how
your documentation will look when it's
printed

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and other will be used for automatic
testing of what we designs if you've used
the truth table option.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And finally we have the GDS action which
is used to build the ASIC files for
manufacturing.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If you want to find out more about that
we have a separate video showing how it
works.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's called how the GitHub action
creates the ASIC files.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Let's take a quick look at the docs
action.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
This is useful to see how your
documentation will be formatted for the
online and print data sheet.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We get a PDF file we can download and
check to see if the formatting and the
picture works.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Let's take a look at the GDS action
results.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We have this nice page with some
warnings, utilization statistics and
standard cell usage.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
If you don't understand a warning join
us on the Discord chat server and post in
the GitHub actions channel.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You can take a look at the cells in use
by clicking these links.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
For example this X-NOR2 gate.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Let's take a closer look at the 3D
viewer.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Right click to pan, left click to change
the perspective, scroll wheel to zoom in
and out.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
On the right we can see which cells are
used and how many, above we have the
control for layer visibility.

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We also have some shortcut keys on the
right.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Pressing "1" hides all the filler cells,
"2" hides the wiring and "3" isolates
the currently selected cell.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'd really appreciate it if you took a
screenshot of your design and posted it
on social media

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
with a description of what it does along
with a Tiny Tapeout hashtag.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Back on the front page of the repository
you'll see we have these three green
lights now for the docs, test and GDS all
passing.

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The GDS status needs to be green to
submit your design.

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Sometimes the GDS action will fail.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
A Wokwi design should almost always
work.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
If not then it's probably our problem
and you should let us know in the Wokwi
channel of the Discord chat server.

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
If you're using an HDL it's usually
because of an error in your design or
because the design is too large.

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
To get more details you can look at the
logs here in the action results or
download the zipped GDS logs out of
hacked and take a look inside.

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:49,000
First check the synthesis log file under
runs > wokwi > logs > synthesis > synthesis.errors for design errors.

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
If your design is too large then the
failure will normally be to do with the
placement or routing part of the flow.

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You can try to reduce your design size
or upgrade to a larger design by
increasing the number of tiles in your
info.yaml config.

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
When you're ready to submit go to
tinytapeout.com and then scroll down to
the submission section.

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Click the button to go to our submission
app.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Sign in with your GitHub account then
copy and paste the URL of your GitHub
repository into the form and press submit.

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
If you have a coupon you can apply it
here otherwise you'll need to pay to
continue.

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
At this point you've created your
project but it's not yet part of the Tiny Tapeout. 
You have to submit a revision first.

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Once that's happened that version of
your design is committed to the shuttle.

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
If you want to make any changes you need
to come back here and submit a new
revision.

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So that's it. Happy hacking and I look
forward to seeing what you make on your
ASIC.

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
