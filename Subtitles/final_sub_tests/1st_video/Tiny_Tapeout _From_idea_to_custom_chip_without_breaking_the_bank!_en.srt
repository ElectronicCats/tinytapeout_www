1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,748
Normally, making a
custom chip costs tens of

2
00:00:02,772 --> 00:00:05,520
thousands of dollars,
and don't forget another

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,000
hundred thousand dollars for renting the
design software.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,200
Oh, and you'll have to sign an NDA to
get started.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,760
And that NDA means you can't share your
design with anyone.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,450
Tiny Tapeout makes
it easier, quicker and

7
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:19,840
cheaper than ever before
to get your designs onto

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,467
a real chip. Open-source
tools, excellent

9
00:00:22,491 --> 00:00:26,240
documentation, and a vibrant
community helps to make it

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,640
much easier to get started and avoid common
mistakes. Tiny Tapeout is for students,

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,037
makers, hackers, universities, and anyone

12
00:00:35,061 --> 00:00:38,240
interested in learning
more or getting their designs

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,877
made into silicon. All
our learning resources

14
00:00:40,901 --> 00:00:43,840
and tools are free to
use, and they're online to

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,458
avoid download,
installation, and licensing

16
00:00:46,482 --> 00:00:49,600
problems. If you're a
total beginner, you can try

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,188
Wokwi, our digital
design and simulator tool.

18
00:00:52,212 --> 00:00:54,800
Or if you know what
you're doing, you can use a

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,466
hardware description
language like Verilog, VHDL,

20
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:02,080
or Amaranth. Then, use
our GitHub action-based

21
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,534
system to build the files
you need for the ASIC.

22
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:06,960
Once the files are
ready, you can explore the

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,522
layout with this really
cool 3D viewer. The

24
00:01:10,546 --> 00:01:14,960
minimum size is 160 x 100
microns, about a thousand

25
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,148
logic cells. And if you
need more space, you can

26
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:21,360
buy extra tiles. Each
design gets access to clock,

27
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,946
reset, and 24 I/Os, with
about 50 megahertz bandwidth.

28
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,080
Tiny tape out isn't
just for digital designs.

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,628
For Tiny Tapeout 6, we've
added analog and mixed

30
00:01:30,652 --> 00:01:33,200
signal support, as well
as support for designs

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,748
made with proprietary
tools like Cadence. Once

32
00:01:35,772 --> 00:01:38,320
the design is ready,
we send it to Efabless,

33
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,268
and they'll manufacture
it on the open-source

34
00:01:41,292 --> 00:01:44,240
Skywater 130 nanometer
process. The first 100

35
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,748
submissions from
individuals will get an early

36
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:49,280
bird discount thanks
to Efabless sponsorship.

37
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,508
And I want to say a really
big thanks to Efabless

38
00:01:51,532 --> 00:01:53,760
for sponsoring this project
and making it possible.

39
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,800
Once we get the silicon back, we save you
time and trouble by mounting the chip onto a

40
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,253
demonstration board.
After plugging the board into

41
00:02:01,277 --> 00:02:03,680
your computer, you select
which design you want

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,268
to be active with our
MicroPython interface.

43
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,880
And that also lets you
adjust the clock speed,

44
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,348
set the inputs, and
monitor the outputs. One of

45
00:02:11,372 --> 00:02:13,840
my favorite things
about this project is that

46
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,088
you're not only going
to get your design, but

47
00:02:16,112 --> 00:02:18,720
everybody else's design
as well. You'll be able to

48
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,948
look through the chip
status sheet and try out

49
00:02:20,972 --> 00:02:23,200
someone else's design.
In our previous runs,

50
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,142
we've seen some
really interesting designs,

51
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:29,600
including RISC-V CPUs,
FPGA's, ring oscillators,

52
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:36,240
synthesizers, USB devices, and lots more.
To get started, follow the video tutorials,

53
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,508
expect it to take between
a few hours and a few

54
00:02:38,532 --> 00:02:40,800
weeks depending on how
complex your design is.

55
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,423
If you get stuck, join
our Discord community

56
00:02:43,447 --> 00:02:46,560
chat. Make sure you
sign up to the mailing list to

57
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,108
keep up to date with our
progress. So have fun, get

58
00:02:49,132 --> 00:02:51,680
involved, and I'm really
looking forward to seeing

59
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,246
what you make on your first ASIC.

60
00:02:54,271 --> 00:02:57,860
