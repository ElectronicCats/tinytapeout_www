1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Normally, making a custom chip costs
tens of thousands of dollars,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,760
and don't forget another hundred
thousand dollars for renting the design
software.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,400
Oh, and you'll have to sign an NDA to
get started.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,920
And by the way, that NDA means you can't
share your design with anyone.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,600
Tiny Tape Out makes it easier, quicker,
and cheaper than ever before

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,680
to get your designs onto a real chip.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,600
Open Source Tools, excellent
documentation, and a vibrant community

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,520
helps to make it much easier to get
started and avoid common mistakes.

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,160
Tiny Tape Out is for students, for
makers, hackers, universities,

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,120
and anyone who's interested in learning
more or getting their designs made into a
chip.

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,920
All our learning resources and tools are
free to use,

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,760
and they're online to avoid download and
installation problems.

13
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,160
If you're a total beginner, you can try
walkway,

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,560
our digital design and simulator tool.

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,000
Or if you know what you're doing, you
can use a hardware description language

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,600
like Verilog, VHDL, or Amaranth.

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,320
Then, use our GitHub Action-based system
to build the files you need for the ASIC.

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,120
This also lets you explore your design
with this really cool 3D viewer.

19
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,080
Once your design is finished, you can
make an order.

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,360
The minimum size is 160 by 100 microns,

21
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,640
and that's just $100 including a PCB.

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,560
If you need more space, you can buy
extra tiles for $50 each.

23
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,160
We also have special deals for group
workshops and universities.

24
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,760
You might be asking, how is it possible
to get the price so low?

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,040
The trick is that we combine all the
little projects into one big design

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,280
using our fast multiplexer.

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,560
160 by 100 microns doesn't sound like a
lot,

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,400
but in our three previous runs we've
seen a load of interesting designs made,

29
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,560
including risk-five CPUs, FPGAs, and
lots more.

30
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,400
One of my favourite things about this
project is that not only are you going to
get your design,

31
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,960
but you're going to get everybody else's
design as well.

32
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,320
You'll be able to look through the chips
data sheet and try out someone else's
design.

33
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,000
Our previous three runs all used a
slower scan chain,

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,840
so this is a really big upgrade.

35
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,800
We're now expecting around 50 megahertz
bandwidth on the I/O.

36
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,920
Another upgrade is that we've now got
more I/O.

37
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,240
We have clock, reset, 8 inputs, 8
outputs, and 8 by directional pins.

38
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,680
Once the design is ready, we send it to
eFabless,

39
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,920
and they'll manufacture it on the open
source Skywater 130nm process.

40
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,800
I want to say a really big thanks to
eFabless for sponsoring this project and
making it possible.

41
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,000
Once we get the silicon back, we save
you the trouble of soldering by mounting
it onto a PCB.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,520
You select which design you want to be
active with these switches,

43
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,720
and then the multiplexer connects the
design to the inputs and the outputs.

44
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,080
To get started, follow the video
tutorials.

45
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,320
Expect it to take between a few hours
and a few weeks depending on how complex
you design it.

46
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,280
If you get stuck, join our Discord chat
server.

47
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,880
Make sure you sign up to the mailing
list so that you know when submission's
open.

48
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:54,400
So have fun, get involved, and I'm
really looking forward to seeing what you
make on it first ASIC.

49
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,280
