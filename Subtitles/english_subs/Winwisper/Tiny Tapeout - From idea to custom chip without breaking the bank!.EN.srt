00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Normally, making a custom chip costs
tens of thousands of dollars, and don't
forget another

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,000
hundred thousand dollars for renting the
design software.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,200
Oh, and you'll have to sign an NDA to
get started.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,760
And that NDA means you can't share your
design with anyone.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,840
Tiny tape out makes it easier, quicker
and cheaper than ever before to get your
designs onto

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,240
a real chip. Open source tools,
excellent documentation, and a vibrant
community helps to make it

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,640
much easier to get started and avoid
common mistakes. Tiny tape out is for
students,

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,240
makers, hackers, universities, and
anyone interested in learning more or
getting their designs

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,840
made into silicon. All our learning
resources and tools are free to use, and
they're online to

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,600
avoid download, installation, and
licensing problems. If you're a total
beginner, you can try

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,800
Watquey, our digital design and
simulator tool. Or if you know what
you're doing, you can use a

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:02,080
hardware description language like
Verilog, DHDL, or Amaranth. Then, use our
GitHub action-based

13
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,960
system to build the files you need for
the ASIC. Once the files are ready, you
can explore the

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:14,960
layout with this really cool 3D viewer.
The minimum size is 160 x 100 microns,
about a thousand

15
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,360
logic cells. And if you need more space,
you can buy extra tiles. Each design gets
access to clock,

16
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,080
reset, and 24 IOs, with about 50
megahertz bandwidth. Tiny tape out isn't
just for digital designs.

17
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,200
For Tiny tape out 6, we've added analog
and mixed signal support, as well as
support for designs

18
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,320
made with proprietary tools like
cadence. Once the design is ready, we
send it to E-Fabless,

19
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,240
and they'll manufacture it on the open
source Skywater 130 nanometer process.
The first 100

20
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,280
submissions from individuals will get an
early bird discount thanks to E-Fabless
sponsorship.

21
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,760
And I want to say a really big thanks to
E-Fabless for sponsoring this project and
making it possible.

22
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,800
Once we get the silicon back, we save
you time and trouble by mounting the chip
onto a

23
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,680
demonstration board. After plugging the
board into your computer, you select
which design you want

24
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,880
to be active with our micro python
interface. And that also lets you adjust
the clock speed,

25
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,840
set the inputs, and monitor the outputs.
One of my favorite things about this
project is that

26
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,720
you're not only going to get your
design, but everybody else's design as
well. You'll be able to

27
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,200
look through the chip status sheet and
try out someone else's design. In our
previous runs,

28
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,600
we've seen some really interesting
designs, including risk 5 CPUs, FPGA's,
ring oscillators,

29
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:36,240
synthesizers, USB devices, and loads
more. To get started, follow the video
tutorials,

30
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,800
expect it to take between a few hours
and a few weeks depending on how complex
your design is.

31
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,560
If you get stuck, join our Discord
community chat. Make sure you sign up to
the mailing list to

32
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,680
keep up to date with our progress. So
have fun, get involved, and I'm really
looking forward to seeing

33
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,280
what you make on your first ASIC.

34
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,860
