00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,430
(Transcribed by Sonix.ai - Remove this message by upgrading your Sonix account) Normally, making a custom chip costs
tens of thousands of dollars. And

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:08,240
don't forget another $100,000 for
renting the design software. Oh, and

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,600
you'll have to sign an NDA to get
started. And by the way, that NDA

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,410
means you can't share your design
with anyone. Tiny Tapeout makes it

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,740
easier, quicker, and cheaper than
ever before to get your designs onto

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,610
a real chip. Open source tools,
excellent documentation, and a

7
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:26,090
vibrant community helps to make it
much easier to get started and avoid

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:31,070
common mistakes. Tiny Tapeout is for
students, for makers, hackers,

9
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,670
universities, and anyone who's
interested in learning more or

10
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,600
getting their designs made into a
chip. All our learning resources and

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,960
tools are free to use, and they're
online to avoid download and

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,160
installation problems. If you're a
total beginner, you can try walkway,

13
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,850
our digital design and simulator
tool. Or, if you know what you're

14
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,910
doing, you can use a hardware
description language like Verilog,

15
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,620
VHDL, or amaranth.

16
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,120
Then use our GitHub action based
system to build the files you need

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,990
for the ASIC. This also lets you
explore your design with this really

18
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:08,270
cool 3D viewer. Once your design is
finished, you can make an order. The

19
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:13,370
minimum size is 160 by 100 microns,
and that's just $100, including a

20
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:18,830
PCB. If you need more space, you can
buy extra tiles for $50 each. We

21
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,430
also have special deals for group
workshops and universities. You

22
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,180
might be asking, how is it possible
to get the price so low? The trick

23
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,450
is that we combine all the little
projects into one big design. Using

24
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:34,550
our fast multiplexer 160 by 100
microns doesn't sound like a lot,

25
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,940
but in our three previous runs we've
seen a load of interesting designs

26
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:43,340
made, including Risc-v CPUs, FPGAs,
and lots more. One of my favorite

27
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,920
things about this project is that
not only are you going to get your

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,860
design, but you're going to get
everybody else's design as well.

29
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,440
You'll be able to look through the
chip's data sheet and try out

30
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,520
someone else's design. Our previous
three runs all used a slower scan

31
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,030
chain, so this is a really big
upgrade. We're now expecting around

32
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,620
50MHz bandwidth on the I o. Another
upgrade is that we've now got more I

33
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,310
o. We have clock reset, eight
inputs, eight outputs and eight

34
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,930
bidirectional pins. Once the design
is ready, we send it to fabulous and

35
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,470
they'll manufacture it on the open
source Skywater 130 nanometer

36
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,250
process. I want to say a really big
thanks to fabulous for sponsoring

37
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,150
this project and making it possible.
Once we get the silicon back, we

38
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:27,140
save you the trouble of soldering by
mounting it onto a PCB. You select

39
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,990
which design you want to be active
with these switches, and then the

40
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,890
multiplexer connects the design to
the inputs and the outputs. To get

41
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,670
started, follow the video tutorials.
Expect it to take between a few

42
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,180
hours and a few weeks, depending on
how complex your design is. If you

43
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,990
get stuck, join our discord chat
server. Make sure you sign up to the

44
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:49,070
mailing list so that you know when
submissions open. So have fun, get

45
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,500
involved and I'm really looking
forward to seeing what you make on

46
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,520
your first ASIC.  (Transcribed by Sonix.ai - Remove this message by upgrading your Sonix account)
