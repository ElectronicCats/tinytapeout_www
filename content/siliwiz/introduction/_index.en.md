SiliWiz will help you get a basic understanding of how semiconductors work and are manufactured at a fundamental level. Semiconductors are the most important technology of the 21st century but only a tiny fraction of us know how they work or are designed and made.

Completing and understanding all the lessons will take around 3 hours.

### Audience

*   Curious people who are probably over the age of 14
*   High schools, universities
*   People who want to get a better understanding of how microelectronics function and how they are made.

### Aims

*   Draw your own logic gate and understand how that gate would be manufactured in a [foundry](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/foundry/).
*   Learn how the gate is built out of the fundamental circuit elements used in chip design
*   Understand how the drawings are used to manufacture the chip
*   Be aware of some of SiliWiz’s limitations and simplifications
