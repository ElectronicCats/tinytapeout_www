### Aim

*   Understand what parasitic means in microelectronics
*   See how we get unwanted capacitance and resistance in our circuits

What do you think will happen to the orange output line when you delete a part of your initial? Make a prediction. To delete a part, select it then either choose ‘delete’ or press the D key.

What happens? Did you expect it? You probably got something like me:

The blue input line keeps doing what it was doing, but the orange output has a nice curve now. What’s happening is that even though there is no direct circuit for the electricity to flow through your letter, we have made a small capacitor by having 2 conductive elements separated with a small non conductive gap. A capacitor is a circuit element with 2 ports. The electric field between the 2 elements works to keep the voltage across the plate the same. The capacitor charges up as the input rises, but then it slowly decays back to 0 once the input stops changing.

What happens to the output curve when you make the input rise faster by decreasing the rise time?

### Parasitic Capacitance

This type of effect is called **parasitic capacitance**. We didn’t really want or expect it, but it’s there because that’s how the world works. Parasitics are often unnoticeable at a larger scale, but the capacitor you just made is only 1μm wide and has a noticeable effect on the output of your circuit. Analyzing parasitics is an important part of microelectronics and can’t be ignored if we want our chips to work properly.

### Parasitic Resistance

Why did the capacitor discharge to zero? Because it also has a **parasitic resistance** that allows the electricity to leak out!
