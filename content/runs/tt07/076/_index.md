### How it works

PoC of custom hardened macro for fab testing and research purposes. It simply expose a set of customized matrices hardened.

### How to test

Select one of the two sets of matrices using the MAT_SEL input. Compare the observated IN --> OUT mapping using the reference model (GDS).

### External hardware

Nothing required.


### IO

| #             | Input    | Output   | Bidirectional   |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- | --------------- |
| 0 | in_mat_0  | out_mat_0  | mat_sel        |
| 1 | in_mat_1  | out_mat_1  |         |
| 2 | in_mat_2  | out_mat_2  |         |
| 3 | in_mat_3  | out_mat_3  |         |
| 4 | in_mat_4  | out_mat_4  |         |
| 5 | in_mat_5  | out_mat_5  |         |
| 6 | in_mat_6  | out_mat_6  |         |
| 7 | in_mat_7  | out_mat_7  |         |
