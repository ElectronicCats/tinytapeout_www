### How it works

This project implements three different analog comparators based on standard logic cells. They are based on work of Sala et al. [1].

Two DACs, based on the work of Yang et al. [2], also implemented using only standard logic cells, with the aid of two 5-bit counters, generate an analog ramp signal to test the comparators.

### How to test

The SEL pin alows to select two different test conditions. With SEL=0, both counters work together, generating a 10-bit sequence. For each step in the DAC1, DAC0 generates 32 different voltage levels, from near 0V to near Vcc. With SEL=1, both counters work independently.

### External hardware

It's necessary an osciloscope to visualize the outputs from the DACs and the comparators.
