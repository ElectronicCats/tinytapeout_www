### How it works

The gps signal generator is a configurable block capable used to test search algorithms for GPS receivers. It is composed by two main blocks:

- Register bank: a set of configuration registers with a uart rx interface for write-only  operations. These registers lets the user control: satellite ID, PRN code phase, doppler frequency, noise level, among others.

- Core: the core of the project is composed by a Gold Code generator, an NCO (numerically controlled oscillator) and PRNGs (pseudo random number generators). The core also provides a 1-bit message input to modulate the generated signal with a "navigation message".

### Serial communication

Register bank configuration is performed through the serial interface. The operation to write a single register is divided in two steps:

- Send address byte.
- Send data byte.

### Register bank description

This section describes the registers of the device and its functionality.

#### Control Register:

- Address: 0x0
- Width: 8 bits

| b7 | b6 | b5          | b4         | b3 | b2 | b1 | b0              |
|----|----|-------------|------------|----|----|----|-----------------|
|  X |  X |  signal off |  noise off |  X |  X |  X |  general enable |

- b0: general enable of the core.
- b4: turn off noise generator.
- b6: turn off signal.

#### Sat_id register:

- Address: 0x2
- Width: 5 bits

| b4     | b3     | b2     | b1     | b0     |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|  id[4] |  id[3] |  id[2] |  id[1] |  id[0] |

- id[4:0]: Selects the satellite PRN code. There are up to 32 satellite PRN codes.

#### Doppler register:

- Address: 0x3
- Width: 8 bits

| b7     | b6     | b5     | b4     | b3     | b2     | b1     | b0     |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|  d[7]  |  d[6]  |  d[5]  |  d[4]  |   d[3] |   d[2] |  d[1]  |   d[0] |

- d[7:0]: Doppler selection. The resultant frequency will be equal to:

$$ \large f_{out} = 4092000.0 -8000.0 + 500.0*(d-176) MHz $$

#### Code phase low register:

- Address: 0x4
- Width: 8 bits

| b7     | b6     | b5     | b4     | b3     | b2     | b1     | b0     |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|  p[7]  |  p[6]  |  p[5]  |  p[4]  |   p[3] |   p[2] |  p[1]  |   p[0] |

- p[7:0]: low byte of the PRN code phase.

#### Code phase high register:

- Address: 0x5
- Width: 8 bits

| b7     | b6     | b5     | b4     | b3     | b2     | b1     | b0     |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| p[15]  | p[14]  | p[13]  | p[12]  |  p[11] |  p[10] |  p[9]  |   p[8] |

- p[15:8]: high byte of the PRN code phase.

#### SNR register

- Address: 0x6
- Width: 3 bits

| b2      | b1      | b0      |
|---------|---------|---------|
| snr[2]  | snr[1]  | snr[0]  |

- snr[2:0]: This indicates how many right shifts (>>) will be applied to the generated signal. Applying more shifts reduces the amplitude of the signal with respect to the generated noise, reducing the SNR.

### How to test

Clock frequency of the system should be set to 16.368 MHz. The register bank is configured with a uart interface at 115200 bauds. Enable the design by writting the corresponding bit of the control bank.

#### External hardware

A micropocessor or FPGA can be used to modulate the navigation message at the input. The output can be recorded for post-analysis or fed to the digital front end of a GPS receiver. The output is a 1-bit signal.

#### Example: expected output of a search algorithm

### IO

| #             | Input    | Output   | Bidirectional   |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- | --------------- |
| 0 | msg_in - Used to modulate GPS signal with custom navigation message.  | sin_out - Sine output with CA+msg modulation + noise.  | Not used        |
| 1 | Not used  | cos_out - Cosine output with CA+msg modulation (no noise).  | Not used        |
| 2 | Not used  | noise_start_out - Start of PRNG sequence used as noise.  | Not used        |
| 3 | rx_in - UART rx input. Used to configure the register bank.  | start_out - Start of GPS signal. This output goes high when the configured phase matches the actual phase of the output signal.  | Not used        |
