# Tiny Tapeout Terms and Conditions

These Terms and Conditions (the “**Terms**”) govern your participation in the Tiny Tapeout semiconductor chip design program (the “**Program**”). The Terms constitute a binding agreement between you and Tiny Tapeout Ltd. (“**Tiny Tapeout**”). By submitting a Design (as defined below) or otherwise participating in the Program, you indicate your acceptance of these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not participate in the Program. If you are an individual entering into these Terms on behalf of a legal entity, you hereby represent and warrant that you are authorized to enter into these Terms on behalf of such entity and bind such entity to these Terms. 



## 1. Submission of Designs



1.1. 
Subject to the terms hereof, you may participate in the Program by submitting a semiconductor chip design (“**Design**”) for inclusion on an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) and Printed Circuit Board (PCB) (collectively, a “**Chip**”) manufactured as part of a specific production run conducted by Tiny Tapeout (“**Production Run**”). If your Design is accepted as part of the Production Run, subject to the terms hereof, you may elect to purchase and receive a physical copy of the Chip, as detailed on the Tiny Tapeout website, available at [https://tinytapeout.com/](https://tinytapeout.com/) (the “**Website**”)


1.2. 
All Designs must comply with and be submitted to Tiny Tapeout in accordance with the applicable terms, specifications, guidelines, and other requirements for the Production Run set forth on the Website and/or associated Tiny Tapeout GitHub pages (collectively, “**Production Run Requirements**”). Each Production Run is limited to the number of Design slots detailed on the Website. In order to submit a Design, you must submit to Tiny Tapeout all documentation, materials and other information requested in the Production Run Requirements (“**Design Documentation**”). Tiny Tapeout may refuse to accept any Design or otherwise permit any individual or entity to participate in the Program and/or any Production Run in its sole discretion, including, without limitation, in the event of any failure to comply with these Terms or any applicable Production Run Requirements. In the event that your Design is not accepted for inclusion in a particular Production Run following your payment of any applicable Fees (as defined below) payable hereunder for such Design, Tiny Tapeout will provide you with a voucher for future Production Runs in the amount of such Fees.  


1.3. 
Subject to the terms hereof, Tiny Tapeout will and you hereby authorize Tiny Tapeout and its contractors to integrate your submitted Design into a combined semiconductor chip design that includes the Designs of other participants in the applicable Production Run (the “**Combined Design**”). By submitting your Design hereunder, you hereby acknowledge and agree that (i) your Design will be incorporated in the Combined Design manufactured on the Chip and will be supplied to other participants in the applicable Production Run, and (ii) your Design and Design Documentation will be published and made publicly available on the Website, Tiny Tapeout GitHub pages and other promotional materials.   


1.4. 
You are solely and exclusively liable for any Design you submit as part of the Program. You acknowledge and agree that Tiny Tapeout is not obligated to verify, review, test or otherwise evaluate any Design and/or Design Documentation submitted by you. By including your Design on a Chip, Tiny Tapeout does not make any representations or warranties in connection with such Design, including, without limitation, in respect of the quality, safety, suitability, legality or performance thereof. The inclusion of your Design on a Chip does not constitute any endorsement, sponsorship or recommendation of such Design by Tiny Tapeout.


1.5. 
Tiny Tapeout is not responsible for and does not guarantee, warrant or make any representation as to the Designs of any other participants in the Program. The inclusion of Designs of other Program participants on a Chip does not constitute Tiny Tapeout’s endorsement, sponsorship, or recommendation of such Designs, or an authorization or representation of Tiny Tapeout’s affiliation with any third party (including other Program participants).
